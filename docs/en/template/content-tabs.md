# Content tabs

Sometimes, it's desirable to group alternative content under different tabs, e.g. when describing how to access an API from different languages or environments. Material for MkDocs allows for beautiful and functional tabs, grouping code blocks and other content.

For more details, please refer to the official documentation: [Content Tabs Reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/content-tabs/)
